## About the Application

This e-commerce site displays all the items in it's shop in a grid. You may filter the items within the shop by type by clicking the buttons in the filter area. If you hover over an item you like, you may add it to the cart. The cart will display the number of items you have in your cart until you are ready to click into the cart to purchase your items. When you are ready, you may click into your cart which will then open a pop up on the screen displaying the items you have in your cart. You may also remove items from your cart here by clicking the trash can icon beside the item you no longer wish to purchase. And when you are ready to purchase, you may simply click the checkout button in the cart which will re-direct you to the REAL etsy shop ;)
Happy Shopping!!
